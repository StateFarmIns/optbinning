OptBinning: The Python Optimal Binning library
==============================================

The optimal binning is the optimal discretization of a variable into bins given a discrete or continuous numeric target. **OptBinning** is a library
written in Python implementing a **rigorous** and **flexible** mathematical programming formulation to solve the optimal binning problem for a binary, continuous and multiclass target type, incorporating constraints not previously addressed.
